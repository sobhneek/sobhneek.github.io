I am an MSc student in the Health Systems Research Program at the [Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of performance measurement, health policy, and healthcare financing.

My thesis, under the supervisor of Drs. [Robert J. Reid](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/robert-j-reid/) and [Walter P. Wodchis](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/walter-p-wodchis/), examines whether there are unaccounted-for factors linking marginalization to the cost of acute clinical care episodes. The findings of this work may help inform future iterations of patient-level funding reforms.

Outside of research, I love visiting new coffee spots in Toronto ☕️ ... a tier list will be coming soon!
