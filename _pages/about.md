I am an incoming MSc student in the [Health Systems Research Program](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/programs/health-systems-research/)  at the [Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. 

I recently completed my HBA with a specialization in Health Studies from the University of Toronto. My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of data science, performance measurement, health policy, and healthcare financing. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare systems.
